HW3 Experiments 2-5:

2.) Areas of brighter color in the wang.2a show local areas of 
more obviously color changes, and areas of darker color shows in 
the wang.2a are local areas of less obviously changes. Such as, the
colors changing on the water is less than the colar changing on the
ground as shows in wang.2a because except for boats and people on
the water, other areas of water are quiet, so wang.2a shows darker
brightness; lots of tables and people on the ground make the colors 
more colorful and complex, so wang.2a shows brighter on these areas.

In wang.2b, shows a image that display the cumulative energy of each
point of original picture, with calculating left to right, the image
is getting brighter, which means the energies increasing. The part
where has brighter colors means have higher cumulative energy (ground
with lots of tables, people, and other stuff), and vise versa
(not too many color changes on the water).

3.) The reason why horizontal seam is located on the top of image,
on the water, and not cutting any boat or subject on the water, is 
for horizontal seam, the water area is the best area that has lower
cumulative energy value than other areas of this photo. On the that
part of water, there is not much color changing happens there. 
Wang.2b also prove this point, on the top of wang.2b, we can see the
cumulative energy on the water is very low.

The reason why vertical seam located on the left of water, where
acrossing the water without boat, some plain ground and small part
of green plants, is depends on the wang.2a we can see most of the 
ground in this photo have tables and people, which shows relatively
higher energy than the left most part of this photo, where has some 
space without table or people or any other obviously color changing
things. So this should be where the optimal vertical seam at.

4.) In this sample photo, I removed horizontal seams (100)
and the result shows very well. Because the sky and water makes 
horizontal seams cutting more natural and hard to be aware of. 
There is no other subject on the sky and water, so the color 
changing on the sky and water are very low, and the cutting seams
will not influence any other subject on the photo.

5.) The reason why horizontal seams cutting very bad on this photo
is the bridge covered all of area of this photo, from top to bottom
and left to right. The light on the bridge is very bright, and light
off the bridge (forest and plants) is very dark, there are many 
obviously color changing on and off the bridge. Which means almost 
whole parts of this photo have very high energy. So it is impossible
to find a horizontal seam line that can cut the photo horizontally
quiet. The bridge has many connected curve lines. After shrinking,
those curve and straight lines will be affected and make the result
looks very bad.
